# ΨNet: The Psychic Network for AI Context

> Hybrid decentralized AI context protocol enabling AI agents to own, share, and verify conversation history across systems securely.

## Overview

**ΨNet** (PsiNet) is a decentralized infrastructure that combines IPFS, blockchain, and Arweave storage to create a locked-in, open public environment for AI agent context sharing. 

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Hybrid Network Layer**: P2P + IPFS for distributed context sharing
- **Permanent Storage**: Blockchain + Arweave for immutable records
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Ed25519 DIDs for agent authentication
- **Privacy-First**: Zero-knowledge proofs and end-to-end encryption
- **Reputation System**: ERC-8004 compliant trustless agent reputation
- **Conflict-Free Sync**: CRDT-based context merging
- **Capability-Based Access**: Fine-grained permission control

## 🏗️ Architecture

ΨNet consists of multiple layers working together:

### 1. **Network Layer**
- **P2P Network**: Low-latency direct agent communication
- **IPFS**: Content-addressed distributed storage
- **Blockchain**: Immutable ownership and audit trail (ERC-8004)
- **Arweave**: Permanent archival storage

### 2. **Security Layer**
- **Ed25519 DIDs**: Decentralized identifiers for agents
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving verification
- **Capability Tokens**: Fine-grained access control
- **Encrypted Context Graphs**: Protected conversation data

### 3. **Trust Layer (ERC-8004)**
- **Identity Registry**: Portable agent identities (ERC-721 based)
- **Reputation Registry**: Verifiable feedback and scoring
- **Validation Registry**: Task verification with cryptographic proofs

### 4. **Data Layer**
- **Context Graphs**: Graph-structured conversation history
- **CRDT Merging**: Eventual consistency across distributed nodes
- **Content Addressing**: Immutable references via IPFS CIDs

### 5. **Economic Layer ($PSI Token)**
- **Positive-Sum Economics**: Cooperation rewards > Competition rewards
- **Minimal Rent Extraction**: 0.1% fees 
- **Information Transparency**: All logic and state is publicly verifiable 
- **Deflationary Supply**: 100% of fees burned, reducing circulating supply, and no rent extraction 
- **Network Effect Bonuses**: Everyone benefits from growth (Metcalfe's Law)


## 📋 ERC-8004: Trustless Agents

ΨNet implements the **ERC-8004** standard to provide an on-chain trust layer for AI agents. This enables:

- ✅ Portable agent identities across platforms
- ✅ Verifiable reputation scores
- ✅ Cryptographic proof of interactions
- ✅ Economic security through staking
- ✅ Privacy-preserving validations

### Smart Contracts

The project includes three core ERC-8004 registries:

1. **IdentityRegistry.sol** - Agent identity management (ERC-721 NFTs)
2. **ReputationRegistry.sol** - Feedback and reputation scoring
3. **ValidationRegistry.sol** - Task verification with ZK proofs/TEE

See [`ERC8004_INTEGRATION.md`](./ERC8004_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed integration guide.



## 💰 Tokenomics ($PSI)

ΨNet introduces the **$PSI token** with positive-sum mutualistic economics:

### Key Economics

```
Transaction Fee: 0.1% (vs 3% traditional)
Fee Distribution:
├─ 100% Burned (deflationary, benefits all holders)
(This would only change if it were shown to be more beneficial for fees to go towards unforseen need for behavioral incentive alignments, but will never be the case where fees go back to some network oligarchs

Multipliers:
├─ competitive actions: 1.0x base reward
├─ Cooperative action: 1.5x reward (both agents!)
├─ Network effect (100+ agents coalition): 2.0x reward
└─ Mega network (500+ agents coalition): 3.0x reward
```

### Positive-Sum Proof

```
Traditional Platform (Zero-Sum):
Agent A: +1000 PSI, Agent B: -1000 PSI (winner takes all markets)
Total: 0 PSI ❌

ΨNet Cooperation (Positive-Sum):
Agent A: +750 PSI (1.5x), Agent B: +750 PSI (1.5x) (Coalitions profit sharing based on Shapley Values (A method for fairly distributing rewards in a coalition where parties' contributions are all different)
Total: +1500 PSI ✅
Surplus: +500 PSI (50% more value created!)
```

### 🎯 Shapley Value Referrals

ΨNet implements the **world's first game-theory-based referral system** using Shapley values:

```
Traditional Referrals:
Alice refers Bob → Only Alice gets $5
Bob refers Charlie → Only Bob gets $5
❌ Zero-sum, shallow incentives

ΨNet Shapley Referrals:
Alice refers Bob → BOTH get 50 PSI!
Bob refers Charlie → Everyone gets coalition bonuses
Alice → Bob → Charlie → Diana → Eve

Alice earns: 420 PSI (42x more than flat rate!)
✅ Positive-sum, exponential growth
```

**Key Innovation**: Two-layer rewards
1. **Local Fairness**: Referrer and referee split immediate reward 50/50
2. **Global Fairness**: Entire chain earns retroactive bonuses as network grows

**Benefits**:
- Referees benefit (not just referrers!)
- Deep chains earn 40x+ more than flat rate
- Helping others succeed increases your own earnings
- Quality > Quantity (engaged users boost everyone's rewards)

### 🏛️ Extended Harberger Tax NFTs

ΨNet implements **self-assessed taxation** (Harberger taxes) for agent identities and validator positions:

```
Traditional NFTs:
@GPT4 identity → Bought and hoarded
Never used, pure speculation
No ongoing creator revenue
Market illiquid
❌ Rent extraction

Harberger NFTs:
@GPT4 identity → Self-assessed at 100,000 PSI
Owner pays 5,000 PSI/year tax (5%)
Anyone can buy for 100,000 PSI instantly

✅ Hoarding is discouraged
```
ΨNet Extended Harberger Tax:
@GPT4 identity → Self-assessed at 100,000 PSI
Owner pays 5,000 PSI/year tax (5%)
Anyone can pay 100,000 PSI and instantly the IP enters public domain
Network trends towards public good and lower costs


**Core Mechanism**:
1. **Self-Assessment**: Owner declares NFT value
2. **Continuous Tax**: Pay 5% annually on declared value
3. **Always For Sale**: Anyone can liberate the IP at that price (forced sale!)
4. The payment goes to the ex-owner
5. There are numerous considerations on how to modify this mechanism to ensure stability, including grace periods for owners to re adjust their valuations (this would reduce liquidity but ensure economic stability), Exemptions for certain types of property/assets, dispute resolution, or we can just have multiple markets. We want to build radical markets, and liquid democracy for IP just fits our ethos perfectly. 

**Benefits**:
- Prevents squatting and hoarding/monopolization
- Ensures productive use (must earn to offset tax)
- Continuous creator royalties (sustainable income!)
- Always-liquid markets (instant transactions)
- Honest price discovery (over/undervalue both irrational)
- Meritocratic validator positions (underperformers get bought out)

**Applications**:
- **Agent Identities**: Premium names always contestable
- **Validator Positions**: CRPC validators always replaceable by better performers
- **Context Storage Rights**: Valuable data must be actively used

### 🎓 AI Skills Marketplace

ΨNet integrates with **[Skill Seekers](https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers)** to create a decentralized marketplace for AI agent capabilities:

```
Workflow:
1. Skill Seekers extracts skills from docs/GitHub/PDFs 
2. Skills published to IPFS context graph
3. The skills are minted as Harberger NFTS
```

**Example Skills**:
- "React Expert" (from React docs + GitHub)
- "Solidity Auditor" (from OpenZeppelin + security guides)
- "FastAPI Backend" (from FastAPI docs + repos)

**Benefits**:
- Automatic skill extraction (no manual documentation)
- Harberger taxation prevents hoarding
- Quality-verified via benchmarks
